# `pnpm` vs `npm` exploit 

This repo showcases how a difference in `npm` and `pnpm`installation from tarballs can be exploited. 
The exploit is recorded in [CVE-2023-37478](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37478).

The package provided claims it prints out a nice message to the user. When installed with `npm` this is true. 
However, the same package can be installed with `pnpm` and it will print out a mean message. 
One could imagine how this could be more maliciously exploited. 

You can find an old, vulnerable version of pnpm [here](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v8.6.7) that works with this exploit.
